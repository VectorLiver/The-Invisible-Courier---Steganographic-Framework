# The-Invisible-Courier---Steganographic-Framework
The Invisible Courier PRO is a high-end steganography dashboard that hides AES-256 encrypted data in PNG pixels. It uses password-seeded PRNG to scatter bits randomly, defeating sequential detection. With a PSNR of 75dB and real-time histogram analysis, it ensures military-grade security and mathematical invisibility for sensitive data.
